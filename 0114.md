Swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking) is a great way to keep in shape. When I go swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking). It makes me feel so good. Swimming is also an important exercise for maintaining a healthy weight.

That is why my dad taught me how to swin(bike/jog/walk/hike) when I was young.

I often go to the swimming pool(park/mountain) near my house. My friends also like swimming(bikeing/jogging/walking/hiking). So, we go to one of the public swimming pools(park/mountain) in our neighborhood. They arw small, not that fancy, and very crowded with people.

But I always enjoy swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking) and spending some time there.

Lask week, I went swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking) at caribbean Bay(Yeoido Park/Gwanak Mountain) with my friedns. To be candid, it is part of my monthly routine. Since it is conveniently located, we went there by public transportation to avoid traffic.

When we got there, we did a warm-up routine with good stretches so that we wouldn't get injured.

Then we enjoye swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking) before having dinner. We stopped from time to time to take a break from swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking).

Feeling the wind in the air was really great. That was swesome. We spent a whole day outside swimming(biking/jogging/walking/hiking) there until it got dark. It was a great day.

My first swimming experience would be about 20 years ago. I can't remember exactly when it was, but my dad told me he took me to a nearby swimming place. As a kid, my family and I spent a lot of time swimming there.

At first, everything was so new to me. And I had a difficult time learning how to do it right. I have kept on practicing and practicing. There were many times I wanted to quit. Eventually I got it right.

That was when I fell in love with swimming. These days I don't go swimming that often.

When I go swimming, I always try to do stretahing before and after swimming so that I don't get hurt.

One time, I went to the park in Yong-in for swimming. It was one sunny day in summer. At the park, I spent about three hours swimming. The view from the park was very beautiful. After three hours of swimming, I got exhausted. I was bathed in sweat. I was taking a break from swimming in one of the rest areas.

I ran into a school friend of mine. I saw someone who looked very familiar to me. What a coincidene. He was a school friend of mine from childhood days. He used to live next door to me.

We talked about our lives and old times. It made me smile.

It was a wonderful swimming experience that I would naver forget.
