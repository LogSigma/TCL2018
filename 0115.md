I usually go on a trip when I have some money and time. Personally, I love to travel in my contry of my country. There are so many places to visit.

My family and I take trips to the islands. My favorite island is Jeju/Hawail since it is so beautiful. We always take a boat trip around the island. You can see palm trees all over the place.

On Jeju/Hawail, there are many things to do and many things to see. People there are very kind and welcomming. The view of the sunset from that island is so beautiful. The seafood there tastes extremely fresh and great.

Since the island has a nive atmosphere, millions of tourists visit Jeju/Hawail every year.

I pack at least 4 sets of clothes, I also bring clothes for the evenings. If I travel to colder countries, I should bring some warm clothes. These take up a lot of room in my suitcase.

Other than that, I take travel documents, and I keep them handy. And I bring my camera to capture my happy moments.

Like others, I carry my laptop and the charger for it and my smartphone. I cannot leave home without them or I am in big trouble.

I normally pack some toiletries like a toothbrush, tooth paste, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and so on. I also take a couple off books to read while sitting in airport lounges, and I carry an iPod with me, so that I can listen to music when I get bored.

The most recent trip I took was to Seoraksan(Fuji-Hakone-lzu) National Park. I went there with my friends last autumn.

If you are on the top of the mountain, you can see lots of traditional villages out there. Most of them have orchards. I stayed overnight in a guesthouse.

At night, when I walked outside, I saw thousands of starts in the sky, which was awesome. During the day, I climbed the mountaines and then walked along rivers with a sense of peace. I really enjoyed the fresh air and all that greenery.

I loved travelling there. I wish I could go there again sometime soon. It was the best trip ever.

To talk about a memorable trip, I remmember the excitement of going to Sokcho(Kinosaki) when I was a child. One of my relatives lived there.

Sokcho(Kinosaki) is very beautiful. It is famous for having a clean, natural environment. It is also renowned for raw fish, hot springs and fresh water.

My familt would always spend a couple of hours walking around the beach. Sometimes, we would rent bikes  and ride them while enjoying the great scenery. I couldn't take my eyes off the amazing views. My favorite  time to go to Sokcho(Kinosaki) was during the winter. My dad and I would go hiking up the mountain and find a stream there and make holes in the ice to catch fish together. We could catch them and bring them home for dinner.

I still have a vivid memory of it. Looking back, it is one of the most memorable experiences of my life.
