I live in an apartment. Im my apartment, There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms. However, I like the living room the most, and it measures aobout five by six meters. That is where I feel most comfortable. There is a big sofa in the living room.

In the living room, I usually watch Tv, relax and take a nap on the sofa. When I'm home alone, I spend much time on the sofa. That's why it is my favorite piece of furniture.

In my room, I have a desk with a chair, a bed and a closet. I do my internet surfing at my desk, and I keep my clothes in my closet.

If I feel stressed after a hard day, my room is the best place in the world. That's pretty much about it.

There are 3 rooms in my apartment. However, the best part of my house is my rooms. I have a few different pieces of furniture in my room.

Frist, whenn you enter my room, there is my bed. It's a king-sized bed. And the mattress is soft. Beside my bed, there is a large closet where I keep my clothes. On the right, there is a computer desk with a chair. I surf the internet or do other things there.

My favorite piece of furniture is my bed, because it's so comfortable and soft.

My room isn't that big, but I think it has everything I need. I'm very happy about that.
