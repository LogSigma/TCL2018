I live in an apartment. Im my apartment, There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms. However, I like the living room the most, and it measures aobout five by six meters. That is where I feel most comfortable. There is a big sofa in the living room.

In the living room, I usually watch Tv, relax and take a nap on the sofa. When I'm home alone, I spend much time on the sofa. That's why it is my favorite piece of furniture.

In my room, I have a desk with a chair, a bed and a closet. I do my internet surfing at my desk, and I keep my clothes in my closet.

If I feel stressed after a hard day, my room is the best place in the world. That's pretty much about it.

There are 3 rooms in my apartment. However, the best part of my house is my rooms. I have a few different pieces of furniture in my room.

Frist, whenn you enter my room, there is my bed. It's a king-sized bed. And the mattress is soft. Beside my bed, there is a large closet where I keep my clothes. On the right, there is a computer desk with a chair. I surf the internet or do other things there.

My favorite piece of furniture is my bed, because it's so comfortable and soft.

My room isn't that big, but I think it has everything I need. I'm very happy about that.

I have a nice neighborhood. it's a quiet and relaxing place. I live in an apartment complex. It has ten apartment buildings.

A good thing about my neighborhood is that there is a bus stop nerby, and the supermarket is within walking distance. I can buy vegetables and groceries at very low prices.

There are also essential community facilities such as hospitals, public libraries, and a sports complex.

That is why I love where I live. I do love where I live.

Well, to talk about my neighbors, I have a close neighbor called MS. Lee. She lives upstairs.

She is a pretty good person. She is honest, nice, beautiful, and a very understanding person. She is also a good listener. When we run into each other, we chat for a while. But, we don't really spend much time together.

Last Saturday, she made some homemade pancakes for us. It was so nice.

She is not just a neighbor. She is more than that. She is very special to me. We are like family.

People tend to make changes over time, and I do too. I have made some changes to my house here and there.

First of all, when we first moved in, I bought a new refrigerator besause the old one made some noise. The brand new one is a lot bigger than the old one. So we can keep more stuff in it at once.

Secondly, I had to buy a new sofa, because the old one was very worn out. I had had that sofa since I was a kid. It had been in our old house for so many years. My new sofa is big and soft.

Although it takes up a lot of space, it's very comfortable. I love it so much.

Things wear out or break. Last summer was hotter than ever. The temperature was above 35 degrees C for two weeks in a row. I couldn't live without air conditioning. I hate being hot.

The problem was that the air conditioner sddenly stopped working, it had turned off itself automatically.

At first, I thought I could fix it myself. But i couldn't. So L called a repairmen, but it took him about two days to get to my place because he was too busy. He finally came to my house and replaced part of the air conditioner. The repair work took about thirty minutes. He was a real pro.

The lesson I learned is to consult with a specialist first no matter how minor or complicated a problem is.
