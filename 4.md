I listen to music using my smartphone. I carry my smartphone wherever I go. I can download or stream music on my smartphone.

I am a member of an online music store called Melon. With Melon, you can play music on your mobile phone or any other device.

My favorite group is Big Bang. Big Bang consists of five members: G-Dragon, Taeyang, TOP, Daesung and Seungri. They are one of the most popular boy groups in Korea.

Big Bang enjoys great popularity and lead the korean Wave known as 'Hallyu'. Their songs have swept all Korean music charts for a longs time.

I first listened to their songs when I was in middle school. I heard about this group from my close friends.

I started to enjoy their songs, because it contains nice stories and messages. That was when they really won my heart. I really like sharing music with my friends, because we have similar tastes.

I first became interested in music when I was a kid. Like other kids in my class, I listened to popular Korean music.

Singers like g.o.d and Rain caught my attention. I really loved their great performances. I had naver heard of them before. But my friends said I would like them. I listened to their music on the internet for the first time, and i really liked them. Soon after that, they became superstars all over the world.

These days, I like to listen to K-pop such as Big Bang and BTS. Korean boy bands are so popular all over the world.

I try to attend K-pop concerts as often as I can. But I don't go to concerts often, because tickets are really expensive.

My favorite song is To My Mother, which is sung by g.o.d. I like the song for several reasons.

The first time I listened to the song was when I was in middle school. It means a lot to me, because my best friend gave the music CD to me for my graduation. It was the first music CD that I got. Back in middle school, I had a hard time. The song helped me overcome some difficulties in my life.

Whenever I listen to the song, I recall my old memories. It also reminds me of my best friend, Taeho. In addition, It gave me my love for K-pop music.

It was my starting point. After getting the album, I listend to it on repeat all the time. For these reasons, it is the most important song in my life.
