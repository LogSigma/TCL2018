I often go to a theater/concert hall called Gangnam Theater/Concert Hall that is nearby. It is known for its outstanding condition.

When I go there, I go public transportation to avoid traffic congestion.

It is spacious and convenient to use. It is an eight-story building. Inside the building, each floor is well laid out. Also, there are some areas where I can relax. It has various facilities that I can use.

For me it is NOT just a theater/concert hall. It's more than that. It is VERY special to me.

Before watching a movie(performance/concert), I usually choose what to see first. I always buy tickets online in advance.

So, I have a lot of free time. I meet with my close friends about 2 hours before the movie(performance/concert). My friends and I love to go for coffee. Usually, we meet at a coffee shop first. We enjoy chatting before we head to the theater(concert hall).

Just before the movie(performance/concert) starts, we grab something to eat and find our seats.

After the movie(performance/concert), we go for something to eat. While dining, we talk about the movie(performance/concert) we saw.

When it comes to my favorite actor, I like Choi Seung-hyun the most. His stage name is TOP. He is an actor and singer who performend in the recent movie called Tazza: The hidden Card.

He is a member of the Korean boy group Big Bang. He is well known for his awesome acting and rapping.

When he first made his debut in a movie, I was a bit skptical of his acting. But, he was really good in the movie.

He is a real actor. He can really act.

The last time I saw a movie(musical) would be about a couple of years ago. The last movie(musical) I saw was a romantic comedy based on the hit songs of ABBA.

The movie(musical) is about a young woman who is about to be married trying to find out who her real father is. She invites all three candidates to her wedding without telling her mom.

It was moving and touching. After the movie(musical), my friends and I went to a bar to have a few drinks and talk about the movie(musical) and life in general.

We thought that the movie(musical) would be a big hit. It was an enjoyable movie(musical).

My parents first got me interested in watching movies/performances/concerts. I remember, as a child, it was such a big pleasure.

When I was a little kid, my parents took me to a theater/concert hall for the first time. As time went on. I got really into them.

As I got older, I started watching movies/performances/concerts with my friends.

Watching movies/performances/concerts makes me happy and relaxed. When I have time and money, I love watching them, and they give me a sense of freedom. These days, I get much enjoyment out of it. I can't even imagine my life without watching thhem. It has become part of my life.

One year, I bought tickets for the hottest show at that time. I decided on mobile ticketing, because it is much more convenient. I saved the e-tickets on my smartphone. The problem was that I hadn't brought the charger with me.

My sartphone went dead halfway to the theater(concert hall). There was no way to prove that I had bought tickets.

I had a hard time finding a charger. Eventually, I was lucky to find one at the ticket booth. In the end, I was able to watch a great show.

I learned an important lession from that experience: if you have mobile tickets, just make sure you're not out of battery.
